JWT - JSON WEB token

securely transmit information between two parties

without JWT I or any one can access each other protected route

JWT is mainly used for authorization purpose, not authentication 

authentication -> who are you ? (Log in password)

Authorization  -> what you can do? add photo, Delete photo, View Photo 
have I the permission to do it? am I the right person for this operation

how JWT works
1. client log in with username and password

2.if verify account done , server(backend) creates a token for the client

3.server sends a token to the client 

4.client side stores the token on either local storage or browser cookie

https cookie is better.
(why token store in cookie?later if need any data access then url send with this token to verify role)
5.next time the client makes a request , a copy of the token is send to the server for authorization.

6.server verifies the JWT token(self token,valid,expire) before giving the authorization 

7.If token is correct then server responds to the client's request

token has three section
1.(Header)first dot, (why it is using, what its work)
2.(Payload)Second dot..email, role information, when token created
3.third dot .. signature (hash, key)

JWT 
1.standard companies used it, Secure API

2.securely transmits information between two parties as a JSON object.

3.use digital signature.
